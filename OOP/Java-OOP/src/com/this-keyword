this refers to the current object - the object that's currently executing the code.
 and it also good for solving name Conflicts (Most Common Use)

class Student {
    private String name;

    public Student(String name){
    this.name = name; // this.name = instance variable, name = parameter.
    this.name is looking up outside of contructor its pointing to the name field.
    }

    public void setName(String name){
    this.name = name;  // Clearly distinguishes instance variable from parameter
    }
}
