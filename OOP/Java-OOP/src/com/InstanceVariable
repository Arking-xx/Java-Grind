each instance of class (each object) get its own instance variables.
instance variable are visible within class and other classes. depending on access modifiers.

access modifiers are:
            Owning Class           Package              Package + Subclass                    Everywhere
public          y                     y                         y                                 y
private         y                     x                         x                                 x
protected       y                     y                         y                                 x
default         y                     y                         x                                 x

class Person {
    String name;  // name is an instance variable with the type of String
    int age;    // age is an instance variable with the type of int
}

"why we need instance variable?"
it because each object has its own state, for example think about a Car class

if we declare a class Car with field like this:

static String color; // imagine this as a color of car.

Car.color = "Red" // all car has a red color since we declare it as static doesn't make sense

unlike this:

String color;

public Car(String color){
      this.color = color;
     }

// each car has its own color
Car car1 = new Car("Red");
Car car2 = new Car("Blue");


How we identify local and instance variable?

class Student {

    // we can identify instance variable because it lived inside of class, outside of method
    // these field has default value on it with string is not explicitly initialize, is null for int = 0 and so on
    // and so fort
    String name;
    int age;
    double gpa;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        // Local variables.
        // compiler error if local variable is not initial or not given default values
        String temp = "Creating student: " + name; // Local variable
        int counter = 0; // Local variable

        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.gpa = 0.0; // assign value
        } // temp and counter are destroy here when app stop running
    }
