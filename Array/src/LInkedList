LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.
It implements all optional list operations and permits all elements (including null).

how do you create a LinkedList?
Example:
LinkedList<Object> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();

Memory Usage
LinkedList use more memory than a ArrayList because stores two reference

Example
LinkedList stores elements with pointers:
[10|→] → [20|→] → [30|→] → [40|→] → [50|→]
 data     data     data     data     data
 next     next     next     next     next
 prev     prev     prev     prev     prev

 Unlike ArrayList
 ArrayList stores elements in a continuous array:
 [10][20][30][40][50]
   ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
 Just the data, nothing else

 ArrayList is more common use in backend
